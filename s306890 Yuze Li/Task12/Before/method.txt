Motivation to Refactor:
As a scrum member, this is probably one of the most commonly used refactorings in the form of methods used in multiple places. 
Duplication is often added to the code base by developers who are lazy or try to generate as much code as possible as quickly as possible.


Pattern/refactoring method:
In this case, I would like to use Remove Duplication method. 
We move the duplicated code to a shared method and you can see no more duplication. It can leads to much fewer bugs because we arenâ€™t copy/pasting the bugs throughout the past code.
