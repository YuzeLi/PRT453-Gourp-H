Motivation to Refactor:
As a scrum member, this refactoring is used quite often when we have a number of methods that we want to “pull up” into a base class to allow other classes in the same hierarchy to use. Here is a class that uses two methods that we want to extract and make available to other classes.


Pattern/refactoring method:
In this case, I would like to use Extract Superclass. 
we just move the required methods into a new base class. This is very similar to the pull up refactoring.
