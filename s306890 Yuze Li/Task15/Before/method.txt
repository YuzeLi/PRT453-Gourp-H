Motivation to Refactor:
As a scrum member, a Collapse Hierarchy refactoring would be applied when you realize you no longer need a subclass. When this happens it doesn’t really make sense to keep your subclass around if it’s properties can be merged into the base class and used strictly from there.


Pattern/refactoring method:
In this case, I would like to use Collapse Hierarchy method. 
Here we have a subclass that isn’t doing too much. It just has one property to denote if the site is active or not. At this point maybe we realize that determing if a site is active is something we can use across the board so we can collapse the hierarchy back into only a Website and eliminate the StudentWebsite type.
