Extract interface means that more than one class uses methods or properties in a class together. Then we can present these methods and properties as a single interface. This has the advantage of relieving code dependencies and reducing coupling.
In this case the RegistrationProcessor class only uses the Create method and the Total field in the ClassRegistration class. So consider making them an interface to call the RegistrationProcessor.
