The Pull Up Method refactoring is the process of taking a method and “Pulling” it up in the inheritance chain. 
This is used when a method needs to be used by multiple implementers. 

As you can see, our Turn method is currently only available to the car class, we also want to use it in the
motorcycle class so we create a base class if one doesn’t already exist and “pull up” the method into the
base class making it available to both. The only drawback is we have increased surface area of the base
class adding to it’s complexity so use wisely. Only place methods that need to be used by more that one
derived class. Once you start overusing inheritance it breaks down pretty quickly and you should start to
lean towards composition over inheritance.
